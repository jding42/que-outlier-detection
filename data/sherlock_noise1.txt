In a large bowl, combine the eggs, schmaltz, stock, matzo meal, nutmeg, ginger and parsley. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Gently mix with a whisk or spoon. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours or overnight.
To shape and cook the matzo balls, fill a wide, deep pan with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. With wet hands, take some of the mix and mold it into the size and shape of a Ping-Pong ball. Gently drop it into the boiling water, repeating until all the mix is used.
Cover the pan, reduce heat to a lively simmer and cook matzo balls about 30 to 40 minutes for al dente, longer for light. If desired, the cooked matzo balls can be transferred to chicken or vegetable soup and served immediately. Alternatively, they may be placed on a baking sheet and frozen, then transferred to a freezer bag and kept frozen until a few hours before serving; reheat in chicken or vegetable soup or broth.

In a small bowl, combine salt, sugar, celery seed, garlic, turmeric, cayenne and black pepper. Mix well.
Place a 14-inch or larger skillet over medium-high heat, and add oil. Heat oil to 350 degrees. Set aside a baking sheet or plate lined with paper towels.
Using tongs, place a whole matzo into the oil, pressing down gently until well submerged. Fry for 20 to 30 seconds, then transfer matzo from the oil to paper towels to drain. The matzo will crisp and change to light golden brown after it is removed from the oil; adjust cooking time as needed.
Sprinkle the top of each warm matzo with about a teaspoon of spice mix. Serve immediately, or cover with a kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place for up to several hours.
