After the fruits are picked and washed, the juice is extracted by one of two automated methods. In the first method, two metal cups with sharp metal tubes on the bottom cup come together, removing the peel and forcing the flesh of the fruit through the metal tube. The juice of the fruit, then escapes through small holes in the tube. The peels can then be used further, and are washed to remove oils, which are reclaimed later for usage. The second method requires the fruits to be cut in half before being subjected to reamers, which extract the juice.[7]

After the juice is filtered, it may be concentrated in evaporators, which reduce the size of juice by a factor of 5, making it easier to transport and increasing its expiration date. Juices are concentrated by heating under a vacuum to remove water, and then cooling to around 13 degrees Celsius. About two thirds of the water in a juice is removed.[6] The juice is then later reconstituted, in which the concentrate is mixed with water and other factors to return any lost flavor from the concentrating process. Juices can also be sold in a concentrated state, in which the consumer adds water to the concentrated juice as preparation.[7]

Juices are then pasteurized and filled into containers, often while still hot. If the juice is poured into a container while hot, it is cooled as quickly as possible. Packages that cannot stand heat require sterile conditions for filling. Chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide can be used to sterilize containers.[7] Plants can make anywhere from 1 to 20 tonnes a day.[6]

Processing

High intensity pulsed electric fields are being used as an alternative to heat pasteurization in fruit juices. Heat treatments sometimes fail to make a quality, microbiological stable products.[8] However, it was found that processing with high intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) can be applied to fruit juices to provide a shelf stable and safe product.[8] In addition, it was found that pulsed electric fields provide a fresh-like and high nutrition value product.[8] Pulsed electric field processing is a type of nonthermal method for food preservation.[9]

Pulsed electric fields use short pulses of electricity to inactivate microbes. In addition, the use of PEF results in minimal detrimental effects on the quality of the food.[10] Pulse electric fields kill microorganisms and provide better maintenance of the original colour, flavour, and nutritional value of the food as compared to heat treatments.[10] This method of preservation works by placing two electrodes between liquid juices then applying high voltage pulses for microseconds to milliseconds.[10] The high voltage pulses are of intensity in the range of 10 to 80 kV/cm.[10]

Processing time of the juice is calculated by multiplying the number of pulses with the effective pulse duration.[10] The high voltage of the pulses produce an electric field that results in microbial inactivation that may be present in the juice.[10] The PEF temperatures are below that of the temperatures used in thermal processing.[10] After the high voltage treatment, the juice is aseptically packaged and refrigerated.[10] Juice is also able to transfer electricity due to the presence of several ions from the processing.[10] When the electric field is applied to the juice, electric currents are then able to flow into the liquid juice and transferred around due to the charged molecules in the juice.[10] Therefore, pulsed electric fields are able to inactivate microorganisms, extend shelf life, and reduce enzymatic activity of the juice while maintaining similar quality as the original, fresh pressed juice.[10]
